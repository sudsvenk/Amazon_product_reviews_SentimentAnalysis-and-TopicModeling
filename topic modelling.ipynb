      "  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n",
      "to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n",
      "the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n",
      "share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n",
      "software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n",
      "GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n",
      "any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n",
      "your programs, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n",
      "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n",
      "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n",
      "them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n",
      "want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n",
      "free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n",
      "these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n",
      "certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n",
      "you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n",
      "gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n",

      "  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n",
      "(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n",
      "giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n",
      "that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n",
      "authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n",

      "authors of previous versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n",
      "modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n",
      "can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n",
      "protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n",
      "pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n",
      "use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n",
      "have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n",
      "products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n",
      "stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n",
      "of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n",

      "  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n",
      "States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n",
      "software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n",
      "avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n",

      "rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n",
      "\n",
      "  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n",

      "in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n",
      "of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n",
      "with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n",
      "the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n",
      "not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n",
      "for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n",
      "and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n",
      "your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n",
      "the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n",
      "makes it unnecessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n",
      "measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n",
      "11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n",

      "measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n",
      "circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n",
      "is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n",
      "the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n",
      "modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n",
      "users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n",
      "technological measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n",
      "receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n",
      "appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n",
      "keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n",
      "non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n",

      "    \"keep intact all notices\".\n",
      "\n",
      "    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n",
      "    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n",
      "    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n",
      "    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n",
      "    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n",
      "    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n",
      "    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n",
      "\n",
      "    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n",
      "    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n",

      "in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n",
      "\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n",
      "used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n",

      "  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n",
      "\n",

      "in one of these ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n",

      "    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n",
      "    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n",
      "    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n",
      "    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n",

      "    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n",
      "    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n",
      "    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n",
      "    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n",
      "    with subsection 6b.\n",
      "\n",
      "    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n",
